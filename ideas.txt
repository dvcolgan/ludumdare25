You are the villain
You are chasing someone,
someone who has your item of importance
you are sauron and they are going to destroy your ring?
you are a businessman and they are going to expose your corruption?
you are a kid and your sibling is going to tell on you?

You are a minion, and you have to warn the boss before the advancing armies arrive so you aren't caught unaware

You are a watcher, and are really cool and have cool shades
and run parkour to get places

set in steampunk era, you are a watcher scouting for enemies
the evil lair is set in some sort of land where you can't have cars and phones haven't been invented yet

Why do you have to run in order to get there?

In the background you see the advancing army in the distance
The advancing army is sneaking quietly, and you can't let them see you either?

space station
wasteland
scary dark

set in a giant abandoned nuclear powerplant

level items:

fences
guardrails

trees
grass
maybe steps
open windows to jump through

grass levels in the forest,
industrial levels in the plant

could be that you have to both get there in time and not die by falling somewhere
there are a number of levels, each of which you are passing off to another runner

idea: there are no breaks between levels, its all just one long continuous run 

you run a full marathon to get there


You are the scout for the king
You are off in the woods when suddenly you see a giant army
You must run through 4-5 levels: forest, plains, villiage, castle

in the future others could make 5 level sets

when they make it to the right side of the screen, you lose and the castle is destroyed and YOU are the villain for not making it back in time, directed by M Night Shamalan
