Fix bugs in state changes
Make it so you die if you fall too hard
Draw dying animations
Figure out what happens when you die - just takes some time and you respawn? You time travel backwards?
Draw more industrial tiles
Draw more forest tiles
Make levels
Add juice - particle effects, 
Expand the sprites into 32x32 - there isn't enough space to make a flowing running animation in 16x32
Figure out music - maybe just use autotracker, maybe import into modplug and tweak it
